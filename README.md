# Gotchas

- GraphQL does not accept unnamed inputs and values, for that reason every
  unnamed function argument and returned value in Solidity are assigned a name
  based on their type and index (e.g.: the second argument of a function would
  be named arg1 if it is unnamed in the contract, while the first value returned
  by a function would be named value0 if it is unnamed in the contract)
- structs (expressed as tuples in Solidty) are converted to object types
- non-struct tuples (e.g.: string[3]) are converted to arrays without a set size
  because GraphQL doesn't support tuples. This can make writing queries tedious
  as the GraphQL schema (and so GraphiQL) will not show that a certain argument
  requires a specific array size to be passed, rather it will just show that an
  array needs to be passed. The transaction will then revert with an error that
  isn't really helpful ("missing argument: coder array someStatuses"). Two
  possible solutions: either detect this error was returned by the contract and
  print a friendly error instead, or transform these tuples to object types
  (although this option makes using the schema less intuitive in my opinion)

# Turborepo starter

This is an official starter Turborepo.

## Using this example

Run the following command:

```sh
npx create-turbo@latest
```

## What's inside?

This Turborepo includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

- `docs`: a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `web`: another [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `ui`: a stub React component library shared by both `web` and `docs` applications
- `eslint-config-custom`: `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-next` and `eslint-config-prettier`)
- `tsconfig`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Utilities

This Turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd my-turborepo
pnpm build
```

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd my-turborepo
pnpm dev
```

### Remote Caching

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup), then enter the following commands:

```
cd my-turborepo
npx turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your Turborepo:

```
npx turbo link
```
